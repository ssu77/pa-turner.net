					I've never been amazing at writing about myself. Never cared too much for it either. I've always been more interested in learning about other people, their stories, and their achievement.
				</p>
				<p>
					At any rate, I went to high school at <a href = "http://www.nsd.org/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectionid=19">Inglemoor High School</a>, class of 2006, where I participated in the IB program and began developing my initial interests in mathematics and technology. Thereafter I enrolled at a junior college and transferred to the University of Washington, Seattle as a mathematics major. After completing course work in modern algebra, analysis and topology, as well as in computer programming, applied math, and statistics I finally graduated in 2012 with my Bachelor of Science.
				</p>
				<p>
					My professional and volunteer activities during and after college have been many and diverse. I received formal training in tutoring and the "mentor-student relationship" from America Reads America Counts when I first began working for them as part of my work study in college. I TA'd in several math classrooms and conducted after school math help sessions at <a href = "http://www.nsd.org/education/school/school.php?sectionid=21">Kenmore Junior High</a>. Since then I've been doing free lance tutoring as well. It started out several years ago as a favor for friends and family and began to grow.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a volunteer for the <a href = "http://washington.providence.org/in-home-services/hospice-of-seattle/">Providence Hospice of Seattle</a>. I spend up to four hours each week visiting with patients and their families/ caregivers to provide companionship and respite. In addition to this I also volunteer for the <a href = "http://www.sakya.org/classes.html">Virupa Educational Institute</a> at the Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism where I help set up for classes, record lectures, and manage the sound board.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of math, education, and technology, my other long term interests include <a href = "https://www.archlinux.org/">Linux</a>, Tibetan Buddhism, analytic philosophy, and inventing things in <a href = "https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>. My favorite books are Godel, Escher, Bach - An Eternal Golden Braid, Science and Sanity, The Problems of Philosophy, and Cryptonomicon.
