			<h2>New layout and change in hours</h2>
			<p>
				Here's a new layout for you! Hope you like it. I've had quite a few changes in my availability, lately due to new clients and some necessary re-arranging of current sessions. My best hours now-a-days are Monday and Friday evenings and Saturday mornings. I know, the last thing you probably want to do on a weekend morning is math homework! But if you're open to it, so am I.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, I apologize for the lack of new tutorials lately. I've been pretty busy with clients, a few coding projects and other things. I still plan to write more soon.

			<h2>Testing on multiple screens</h1>
				<p>
					I viewed the "about" page on my dad's iPad earlier today and it doesn't render the page properly at all, yet the other pages are just fine. I have no idea why. They all use the same style sheet and that's mainly what I've been working on lately.
				</p>
				<p>
					After I figure out what's going on with that I'm going to fix the height of these content boxes and add scroll bars instead. It's just cleaner.
