					This tutorial is primarily intended for my junior high school level students. From seventh grade on, as you go further in math you find that the steps to solving a problem become more detailed and sophisticated. It's cumbersome to have to do it all out on paper, but you still don't want to make mistakes either for what parts of the problem you choose to do "in your head." Some of the common tasks junior high school students are faced with as they progress are: going between decimals and fractions on the fly, multiplying large numbers not included in their times tables up to 12, and how to make sure you're doing the right thing during a test (or in any situation at that). 
				</p>
				<h3>Multiplication</h2>
				<p>
					It's helpful to think of multiplication as a way of counting. Suppose you're multiplying \( a \times b \). As you know this is the same as
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								a \times b = \underbrace {a + a + a + \dots + a}_{b-times} 
							\end{equation}
						$$
					Then as long as a is something that's easy to count up by, like 5, 10, 4, or some other small numbers, then all we have to do is count up by that number b times. Of course that's not always the case. So what do we do if we're given something like \( 17 \times 9 \)? We'll use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property">distributive property</a>. You remember what that is, right? If not, click the link to refresh your memory. The distributive property is a useful device for breaking up ugly numbers that we can't easily count by to smaller numbers we <em>can</em> count by. What you have to decide as the student is how you want to do that. For \(17 \times 9 \) let's try the followig...
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								17 \times 9 = (10 + 7) \times 9 = 10 \times 9 + 7 \times 9
							\end{equation}
						$$
					Now we've got more things to multiply, but at least we know what they all are without having to consult a calculator! Continuing the example we'll find that \( 10 \times 9 + 7 \times 9 = 90 + 63 = 153 \). (Now if it's appropriate you can verify this with your calculator to be sure). Note that we were able to do this easily because we can count by 10's and 7's without too much trouble, but couting by 17 up to 9 times is harder. Try some of these on your own.
						$$
							11 \times 7, \; 13 \times 9, \; 4 \times 23
						$$
				</p>
				<h3>Fractions and decimals</h2>
				<p>
					In going from decimals to fractions, there are two basic ways that I find are helpful to deal with this. The first is a sure-shot method that will always work. Look at how many numbers past the decimal you have (eg 0.14 goes to the hundredths place). Take that number without the decimal and put it over 100 like so
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								0.14 = \frac{14}{100}
							\end{equation}
						$$
					And simplify. This tends to be easier if the numerator is even, since you can always start by dividing the top and bottom by 2 and keep going. So in this case we have \( 0.14 = 14/100 = 7/50 \). If you have a decimal that goes out to the thousandths place, then you just repeat the process above but place the number over 1000 instead. Obviously if the number you have on top is prime, it's not going to get any simpler. Also note that if you do this then you can only divide the top and bottom by factors of 100, 1000, etc. depending on how many numbers you have past the decimal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other method is to have some examples already memorized and then be able to work with those. Some "mile markers" that are good to know in this case are as follows:
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								\frac{1}{8} = 0.125, \; \frac{1}{6} = 0.166\;, \; \frac{1}{3} = 0.33, \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
							\end{equation}
						$$
					When you have these in mind, it's easy to multiply the decimals (or fractions), by small numbers lik 3, 4, or 5 to get decimal representations of numbers like 3/8 (0.125 times 3 = 0.375). Note that this is also a useful method for converting from fractions to decimals, too!
				</p>
				<h3>Verifying your work</h2>
				<p>
					Being in a test is a situation much different than nonchalantly doing homework in your kitchen. You're pressed for time and the correctness of your answers is much more critical than it is on homeowork. Naturally you want a quick way to make sure that after you've spent some of this precious time working on something that you did it right. The first thing you want to know is some general range in which your final answer will fall in. For example if you have to find the area of a parallelogram that just fits inside of 4 by 7 rectangle, then you better get an area less than 28! <br>
					A second item to check during tests is that your answer makes logical sense. Always be sure exactly what kind of object/item/number you're being asked to find. If you need to compute the probability of rolling three even numbers in a row on a dice and you get a number bigger than one or less than zero, you screwed up someplace.<br>
					Finally, the most common situation in algebra, if you're solving an equation of any sort of a variable, x, then <em>plug in your final answer for x into your origional equation</em> and make sure you get a true statement out of that. For example:
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								7x^{2} -2 = 0
							\end{equation}
						$$
					Then you get that \( x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{7}} \). Is that true? We better make sure ...
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								7 ( \underbrace{\pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}}_{x})^{2} - 2 = 0
							\end{equation}
						$$
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								7(\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}})^{2} - 2 = 0
							\end{equation}
						$$
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								7(\frac{2}{7}) - 2 = 0
							\end{equation}
						$$
						$$
							\begin{equation}
								2 - 2 = 0
							\end{equation}						
						$$
					And it turns out to be a true statement! Ultimately, checking your work comes down to being able to view the problem from at least one other perspective and making sure your answer works from all points of view available to you. What I've shown you here are examples of good things to do once and a while and can potentially save you a lot of hassle during a test. Good luck and good studying!
