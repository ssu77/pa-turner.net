			<h2>Math Tutoring</h1>
	    		<p>
					Currently I work as a freelance mathematics tutor in the Seattle and greater-north Seattle area. Having been the beneficiary of a superior education at the hands of many dedicated and skilled professors, one of my primary professional interests is in math education. In particular, I'm interested in finding new ways to relate math and information technology to today's students other than the traditional class room style lecturing. I believe that students are more likely to understand, and even enjoy, the curriculum if they're directly engaged in it, one-on-one, with someone who's been in their shoes before.
				</p>

					I earned my comprehensive B.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington, Seattle in 2012. During my time as a college student I worked for America Reads America Counts where I was a T.A. for several math classes. I also conducted after school math help sessions at <a href = "http://www.nsd.org/education/school/school.php?sectionid=21">Kenmore Junior High</a> in lue with the YMCA's Hang Time program there. Now my tutoring activities are done free lance. I'm always happy to meet with new clients and discuss learning skills. As a tutor I try to ballance sessions between actual math and how to recognize and overcome obstacles to learning. I can tutor in all levels of math from elementary arithmetic to advanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently my rates are as follows: I charge $20 - $25 per hour for private tutoring based on the level of math and client's financial ability. For small groups of two to four students I charge $15 - $20 per hour. All students should be studying the same curriculum for group sessions.
